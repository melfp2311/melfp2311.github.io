Homework 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and it has dynamically updated HTML powered by JavaScript code. 

Eveytime the user clicks on "generate password" a prompt will ask the user for the number of characters the password must contain. The nu,ber should be between 8 and 128, if it's not it will ask again for the value.

Then, using prompts the user can choose all variables that will be included in the password: lower case letters, numbers, upper case letters or special characters.

Using the criteria from the prompt answers, a password will be generated.

The function will repeat itself everytime the user clicks on "generate password".
